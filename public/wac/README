This is a demo widget for Ripple (http://ripple.tinyhippos.com). The widget itself resides in /public and is by default configured for the JIL 1.2.x SDK & Emulator (who merged into WAC 1.0).

It showcases various features within Ripple's environment and provides a quick introduction to Ripple and examples of various platform API calls that it supports.

Currently the demo widget focuses on WAC specific API calls but will be extended to demos for all supported platforms (currently there is also a default phonegap application as well).
